Measurements ------------------------------
Time is measured using the Time.h library in C, taking the time after training and subtracting it by the time before training.

The Rate of Correctness is measured by taking the counted number of correct identifications and dividing it by the total number of testing data

Other Information -------------------------------
Work on Speculative Backpropagation has started and as of right now progress is showing. Currently, its takes more time than the regular backpropagation but
this is due to a weaker implementation of it. Next, I plan on rereading the papers and restructuring the speculative backpropagation code.
